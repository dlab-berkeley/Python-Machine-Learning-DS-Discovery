    "Now let's talk about machine learning with **regression**. Regression is a **supervised** problem in which we use a set of features (also called independent variables or predictors) to try to predict a continuous output, or a real valued number. This is a supervised problem because we have an existing dataset in which we know what the actual outputs are for a set of samples. By showing a model enough examples, the hope is that the model can be trained to predict the output value given just the set of features, where the prediction is as close to the real value as possible.\n",
