[![D-Lab Datahub](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-datahub-blue)](https://dlab.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FPython-Machine-Learning-DS-Discovery&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FPython-Machine-Learning-DS-Discovery%2F&branch=main) [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dlab-berkeley/Python-Machine-Learning-DS-Discovery/HEAD)

This repository contains the materials for D-Labâ€™s Python Machine Learning workshop. Prior experience with [Python Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Fundamentals), [Python Data Visualization](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Data-Visualization), and [Python Data Wrangling](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Data-Wrangling) is assumed.

## Workshop Goals

This 2-hour Python Machine Learning Workshop by the Discovery Consultants will cover the following topics: Overview of Machine learning, Methods of Linear Regression, Logistic Regression (Classification), and Data Preprocessing. The workshop will consist of a live coding demo with a live question-answer session.

Based on [dlab-berkeley/Python-Machine-Learning]([url](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Machine-Learning))

## Installation Instructions

Anaconda is a useful package management software that allows you to run Python and Jupyter notebooks very easily. Installing Anaconda is the easiest way to make sure you have all the necessary software to run the materials for this workshop. Complete the following steps:

1. [Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.9 distribution)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Click "Download" and then click 64-bit "Graphical Installer" for your current operating system.

2. Download the [workshop materials](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-Machine-Learning-DS-Discovery):

* Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
* Click "Download Zip".
* Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (we recommend Desktop).

3. Optional: if you're familiar with `git`, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering `git@github.com:dlab-berkeley/Python-Machine-Learning-DS-Discovery.git`.

## Run the code

Now that you have all the required software and materials, you need to run the code:

1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application. You should see the green snake logo appear on your screen. Note that this can take a few minutes to load up the first time. 

2. Click the "Launch" button under "Jupyter Notebooks" and navigate through your file system to the `Python-Machine-Learning-DS-Discovery` folder you downloaded above.

3. Click `00_introduction.md` to begin.

4. Press Shift + Enter (or Ctrl + Enter) to run a cell.

## Is Python not working on your computer?

If you have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can run these lessons on UC Berkeley's DataHub by clicking this button:

By using this link, you can save your work and come back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go straight to the D-Lab DataHub [https://dlab.datahub.berkeley.edu](https://dlab.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FPython-Machine-Learning-DS-Discovery&urlpath=tree%2FPython-Machine-Learning-DS-Discovery%2F&branch=main), sign in, and you click on the `Python-Machine-Learning-DS-Discovery` folder.

If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in the cloud, by clicking this button:
